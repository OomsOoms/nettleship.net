had to rename stuff in register password service tbf my func naming there is so so shitty

add form to index.ts

add to page

the rest of it is just a register page with stuff deleted like i think thats fine to write in the docs to avoid repetition

oh and then the token stuff fuck
idk how to get the token from the url query

token: window.location.search.split('=')[1],

easy

ERROR i sent it in the body and not the bearer token

i needed to do resposne.data.message as it would give an error as without .message it was an object which the component cant display






profile header component






add game stats to user model

tconfig for the @ imports




sent request to edit profile and it didnt work cuz they were all empty string apart from the one i changed so then it got 400

        Object.entries(formData).forEach(([key, value]) => {
            if (value !== undefined && value !== null) {
                formDataToSend.append(key, value);
            }
        });

        fixed by changing that



in the backend the auth route also returns the displayName now

need to make it check the query for the display name then the displayanme so anyone can set it
it should throw an error if its not included
